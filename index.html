      <h2> Coding Challenge #1: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has
      all unique characters.</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="form-container" class="form-container">
      <h2>Enter your string here:</h2>
      <input type="text" class="user-string" value="" onkeypress="checkForEnter()"></input>
      <button class="button" onclick="checkString()">Submit</button>
    </section>

    <section class="response">
      <h2>Does it contain only unique characters?</h2>
      <h3 class="answer"></h3>
    </section>

    <section class="explanation">
      <p>There are many ways to approach this challenge. My first instinct was to
        create an array, pick off one character at a time from the string,
        and see if that character is in the array. If it's not in the array, great,
        time to stick it in there and move on to the next character. If it continues
        like that for all of the characters, wonderful! The string has all unique characters.
        However, if the character being examined is already in the array, the algorithm
        returns false.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        function uniqueChars(inputString) {
          var myArray = [];
          for (var i=0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
            if (myArray.indexOf(inputString[i]) > -1) {
              return false;
            } else {
              myArray.push(inputString[i]);
            }
          }
          return true;
        }
      </pre></code>

      <h3>Part Two: What if you cannot use additional data structures?</h3>

      <p>With this additional restriction, my original solution with an array is no
        longer going to work. Now it's time to use a nested loop to compare each
        character with each of the other characters in the string. Notice that we
        don't want to compare a character with itself. Alse, to be more efficient,
        the character is compared against the ones that come after it in the string,
        since there is no need to recompare it to characters that come before it.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
        function uniqueCharsNoStructures(inputString) {
          for (var i=0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
            for (var j=i+1; j < inputString.length; j++) {
              if (inputString[i] == inputString[j]) {
                return false;
              }
            }
          }
          return true;
        }
      </pre></code>

      <h3>Part Three: Other Solutions</h3>

      <p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850" target="_blank">
        <em>Cracking the Coding Interview: 50 Programming Questions and Solutions</em></a>,
        the author offers another solution to the first part of this challenge.
        If the string is an <a href="http://www.beginningtoseethelight.org/ascii/index.htm"
        target="_blank">ASCII</a> string and not a Unicode string, the first step
        is check whether the string's length is greater than the number of ASCII
        characters (256). If that is the case, the string must have some duplication.</p>

      <p>Next, a boolean array is created with a length of 256, with all of its values
        initially set to false. Looping through the string's characters, each character
        is converted to its ASCII decimal value. Then the boolean array is checked
        at that index to see whether it is true or false, depending on whether
        that character has been seen before. If false, the array at that index is
        changed to true for future reference. If true, the function returns false.
        If the function finishes the loop, it returns true.

      <pre><code>
        function uniqueCharsWithBooleanArray(inputString) {
          if (inputString.length > 256) {
            return false;
          }
          var myBooleanArray = new Array(256).fill(false);
          for (var i = 0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
            var val = inputString.charCodeAt(i);
            if (myBooleanArray[val]) {// Already found this char in the string
              return false;
            }
            myBooleanArray[val] = true;
          }
          return true;
        }
      </pre></code>
